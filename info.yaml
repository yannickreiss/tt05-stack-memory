# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    0        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here.
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
  source_files:
    - tt_um_yannickreiss_lifo_fifo.v
  top_module:  "tt_um_yannickreiss_lifo_fifo"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 4

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Yannick Rei√ü"      # Your name
  title:        "Stack memory"      # Project title
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Implementation of memory as stack."      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
        The stack can store one byte per slot.
        It is controlled by two signals.
        The first one is *push* to save a byte to memory.
        The other one is *pop* which reads the top stack.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
        Push values in ascending order. Then read them. Now the values should be in descending order.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:
    - input0
    - input1
    - input2
    - input3
    - input4
    - input5

# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - output0
    - output1
    - output2
    - output3
    - output4
    - output5
    - output6
